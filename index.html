	The universe is full of coincidences and sometimes that’s all they are, a set of random numbers that appear to form a pattern, yet other times there is a cosmic connection between different worlds in different places. Now maybe this is a coincidence but there is a world called Rozier, which is not entirely unlike our own, it has some very similar properties the most striking of which is a language which so close to English you would have sworn that anyone writing in this dialect was just a very dyslexic English speaker. It is this world connected to our own, perhaps by cosmic creation or even by coincidence, that I want to bring you into, a world that has been ravaged by war, a war that is becoming impossible to justify for either side.

Now when it comes to cosmic connections from time to time not only can two worlds link themselves together. People can also link themselves and I’m presenting you the chance to do just that however you can only affect the decisions of one person, everyone else will keep making their decisions but that doesn’t mean you can’t influence fate so make these decisions wisely.

Follow to next page and you’ll be presented with a choice Abbey or Turner. Abbey is a freedom fighter or at least that’s what he would say. He is fighting with the Quicunque group who will fight for personal freedoms and individuality beyond all else, believing in each individual person overall. Then there’s Turner he is a fighter in his own words “the morally right thing to do” him and the Tyrannidem army will do whatever it takes to ensure that a morally just society in their eyes is preserved so who will you choose Abbey or Turner?
